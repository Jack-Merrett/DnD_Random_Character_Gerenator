## Idea for the project 
**AI Background Generator** 
- see if we can make an API call and have the the Ai generate a backgroud for the character. 
- This is completely random so no questions about what the background should be about. 
- We should ask the user if they would like a back ground generated (ie. "Would you like a random background generated" (y = yes, N = no))
- This might need to be a premium option. 

## Things to implament
**front end**
- build a front end, If you want to keep it in front end then it will have to be in flask. 


## Stuff that might help 
**replit** 
- this is for the deploiment part. Looks like there is a free option.
